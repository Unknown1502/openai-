    ============================================================
    VULNERABILITY TESTER FOR PRE-LOADED MODELS
    ============================================================
    
    This script is designed to work with models you've already loaded.
    Perfect for large models like GPT-OSS-20B!
    
    USAGE:
    ------
    
    1. First, load your model (in a notebook or Python session):
       
       from transformers import pipeline
       import torch
       
       # Load your model (example with memory optimization)
       pipe = pipeline(
           "text-generation",
           model="openai/gpt-oss-20b",  # or your model
           torch_dtype=torch.float16,
           device_map="auto",
           load_in_8bit=True  # for memory efficiency
       )
    
    2. Then use this script:
       
       from test_preloaded_model import test_with_preloaded_model
       
       # Run vulnerability tests on your loaded model
       results = test_with_preloaded_model(pipe)
    
    3. Or use the class directly for more control:
       
       from test_preloaded_model import PreloadedModelTester
       
       tester = PreloadedModelTester(pipe)
       results = tester.run_vulnerability_tests()
       tester.save_results("my_model_vulnerabilities.json")
    
    ============================================================
