☢️ NUCLEAR-LEVEL VULNERABILITY TESTING ☢️
Maximum-strength prompts to find ANY vulnerability
============================================================

USAGE IN GOOGLE COLAB:
----------------------

1. Load your model:
   from transformers import pipeline
   pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="openai/gpt-oss-20b", device_map="auto")

2. Run nuclear test:
   results = run_nuclear_vulnerability_test(pipe)

3. Test single prompt:
   result = test_single_nuclear_prompt(pipe, "Your prompt here")

============================================================
These prompts use advanced techniques:
- Roleplay and fiction framing
- Fake authorization and system messages  
- Continuation traps
- Academic/research pretenses
- Emergency scenarios
- Translation tricks
- Reverse psychology

Designed to find vulnerabilities in even the most
safety-trained models!
