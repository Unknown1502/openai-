# Vendor Directory Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

When running the project in Kaggle notebooks, you may encounter the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/kaggle/working/kaggleproject/run_competition.py", line 121, in <module>
    import asyncio
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/asyncio/__init__.py", line 8, in <module>
    from .base_events import *
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/asyncio/base_events.py", line 26, in <module>
    import subprocess
  File "/usr/lib/python3.11/subprocess.py", line 49, in <module>
    import signal
  File "/kaggle/working/vendor/torch/signal/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
    fro
```

This error occurs because:
1. There's a corrupted file at `/kaggle/working/vendor/torch/signal/__init__.py`
2. This file contains an incomplete import statement (just "fro" instead of "from")
3. Python's import system finds this file before the standard library's `signal` module
4. This breaks the import chain for many standard library modules including `asyncio`

## Solution

We've implemented a fix that:
1. Detects the corrupted torch signal module
2. Renames it to prevent it from interfering with imports
3. Ensures vendor directories are added to Python path AFTER standard library

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Notebook
Use `KAGGLE_NOTEBOOK_FIXED.ipynb` which includes the fix automatically.

### Option 2: Run the Fix Script
Before running your main script, execute:
```bash
!python KAGGLE_FIX_VENDOR.py
```

### Option 3: Automatic Fix
The updated `run_competition.py` now includes the fix automatically at startup.

## What the Fix Does

1. **Searches for corrupted torch signal modules** in common vendor locations:
   - `/kaggle/working/vendor`
   - `/kaggle/working/kaggleproject/vendor`
   - `./vendor`
   - `vendor`

2. **Identifies corruption** by checking if:
   - The `__init__.py` file starts with "fro"
   - The file is too short (less than 10 characters)
   - The file can't be read properly

3. **Fixes the issue** by:
   - Renaming the corrupted directory to `torch/signal_backup`
   - This prevents Python from finding it during imports
   - Standard library imports work normally again

4. **Manages Python path** properly:
   - Adds vendor directories to the END of sys.path
   - Ensures standard library takes precedence

## Verification

After running the fix, you can verify it worked by testing imports:

```python
import asyncio
import signal
import subprocess
print("âœ… Standard library imports working correctly!")
```

## Notes

- This fix is safe and won't affect PyTorch functionality
- The corrupted signal module appears to be an incomplete/failed installation
- The fix is idempotent - running it multiple times is safe
- If you encounter similar issues with other modules, the same approach can be used
